# Copper Nuggets

A very basic Fabric mod which only adds Copper Nuggets to Minecraft.

## Background

This is the first Minecraft mod I have created, and is intentionally very
basic for this reason.

Copper is a nice addition to Minecraft, but I find there's a couple minor
issues with it:
- You cannot craft Copper Nuggets from it, which is a minor inconsistency with
  other Minecraft metals
- There are not as many useful recipes for Copper. In particular, it would be
  nice to use it as a material for armor/equipment, or a substitute for Iron
  in some recipes

This mod addresses the first bullet point, but not the second. That part was
outside the initial scope for this project, but could be done either by adding
more functionality to this mod, or creating a separate mod with a dependency
on this one.

## Alternative mod(s)

After creating this mod, I discovered that somebody else already made a Fabric
mod called **Copper Equipment**, which appears to also implement Copper Nuggets
and much more Copper-related functionality to make it a more useful resource.
I have not personally tried it yet, but it might be a more useful alternative
to what I made.
